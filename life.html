            <p>Yes, I know, I’m just like you. I’m exhausted, tired, and I can’t wait until the weekend. The big event that I’m looking forward to this week is the St. Jacobs Farmers’ Market located at 878 Weber Street North. This is a year-round market packed with individuals attending. This event only occurs on Saturday though, so be sure to clear up your schedule on Saturday and move all your other plans to Sunday! I personally love this market. It’s great to buy your vegetables in bulk from vendors that sell the vegetables and fruits straight from the farm. Not to mention, there are many great places to eat. I would definitely recommend you to try out the baked goods, you won’t regret it trust me. Be sure to arrive early because this place gets packed very quickly! </p>

    
            <h2 class="section-heading">Eat, Work, Sleep, Repeat</h2>

            <p>As a university student, I know the struggle. I live the struggle. This struggle is the monotonous day-to-day routine that all students experience. We wake up, eat, work, then before we know it, it’s time to sleep. This routine repeats and repeats itself until summer comes by, but then, it is quickly taken away from us as September comes immediately after. We need to be able to find some joy in the day to prevent this monotonous routine from holding ourselves back. Here is a list of recommendations that I do to make my day less boring.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living in the present.</span>
            <ol>
  <li>Find something you love to do<br>Finding something you love to do definitely makes your day a little less worse. In my case, I love to cook. I love to grocery shop and plan all my meals for the entire week. I typically cook and prep in the beginning of the week all future meals that I will be keeping in the fridge. This allows me to enjoy myself while cooking and also saves a lot of time throughout the week so I don’t need to constantly be in the kitchen making a gourmet meal. 
  </li>
  <li>Prioritize your time well<br>You may think that you’re constantly being held back with the overwhelming amounts of readings, assignments, and midterms that are constantly coming your way. There is definitely a way out of this, right? Well, from previous experience, it is important to balance your time well. You can always make time to do something fun, or do something other than working on your school projects. In my opinion, I believe that if you’re working on an assignment, reading and/or writing notes, you should turn off all distractions (cellphone, facebook, etc.). This will increase your productivity and allow you to finish your assignments earlier and better.  
</li>
  <li>Make time for friends<br>I know, this tip is crazy! Sometimes, you need to take a break from school. You can’t always be staring at your laptop trying to finish another chapter of notes, right? Making time for friends allows you to have a break and in return, become more productive. Your body doesn’t work in a way where you can be concentrated for a long period of time. So instead, take a break, and hang out with your friends.
